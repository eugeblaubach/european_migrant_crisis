European Migrant Crisis

Week 1

Before starting on the content, I spent time deciding the best way to lay out the app. I used computer paper to storyboard the slides. This helped significantly when I was marking up the HTML. My sections and articles are strategically labeled and ordered to accommodate the web design. I also conducted extensive research on the topic and wrote the content that will be featured on the app. It was difficult to condense all the information I learned.

I also researched how to make the page work like slides.

I found a way to make the a button jump to a specific part of the page by creating bookmarks with the id attribute and then making a link to it.

However, I know that in order to make it look like slides I'll need to adjust the viewport and make sure my background images are all the same size. I'd like to ask about this, because I'm not fully understanding what I'm reading online.

I encountered these two features which would make the app look really cool. I'm not sure if they're compatible with the other scripts i'll be using.

I'm pleased with the work I've done so far, especially how i've been able to use website design to enhance my argument and make it easier to digest. I have a much clearer vision of what I want to do, but naturally I have more questions now than before I started. After speaking with you on Tuesday, I expect to have a clear strategy for tackling the script.
