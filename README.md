European Migrant Crisis

Week 1

Before starting on the content, I spent time deciding the best way to lay out the app. I used computer paper to storyboard the slides. This helped significantly when I was marking up the HTML. My sections and articles are strategically labeled and ordered to accommodate the web design. I also conducted extensive research on the topic and wrote the content that will be featured on the app. It was difficult to condense all the information. I decided to deviate from the original plan and only focus on France and Germany. Otherwise it would be way too much information for the site.

I also researched how to make the page work like slides.

I found a way to make the a button jump to a specific part of the page by creating bookmarks with the id attribute and then making a link to it.

However, I know that in order to make it look like slides I'll need to adjust the viewport and make sure my background images are all the same size. I'd like to ask about this, because I'm not fully understanding what I'm reading online.

I encountered these two features which would make the app look really cool. I'm not sure if they're compatible with the other scripts i'll be using.

I'm pleased with the work I've done so far, especially how i've been able to use website design to enhance my argument and make it easier to digest. I have a much clearer vision of what I want to do, but naturally I have more questions now than before I started. After speaking with you on Tuesday, I expect to have a clear strategy for tackling the script.

Week 2

This week I made some serious progress. With the help of this tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enh5Dc9L_M0&t=302s), I figured out how to set a background image within a container. This allowed me to stack the background images one on top of the other. By using z-index, I was able to layer an overlay (a black square with opacity) on top of the image. I also learned that Bootstrap doesn't center objects vertically. Consequently, centering the text is the first slide was a challenge.

I created all the buttons that let the user navigate through the app. The buttons link to anchor points (containers) down the page. I also styled the buttons and positioned them on the page. They are responsive.

As for javascript, I figured out the modal box, which was a nightmare. I'm pretty sure the instructions on the Bootstrap website are wrong. I got it to work, and after styling it next week it should look really good. I also added a Highchart, but I don't like how it looks. I'm not sure if it can be styled. We'll see next week.

Week 3

Just a few last minute touches left. This week I styled the whole site. Changed the buttons. Removed backgrounds from all of my Highcharts and changed all their label colors. This was incredibly tedious, but it paid off. The graphs really work with the design now. Finding good quality/public domain images also took forever. I added some JavaScript so that the overlay and the text box fade in every time you click the button. I styled the modal box and repositioned it. That was a challenge, but it looks great now.

I added and changed up some of the content. I ended up learning so much about Germany (maybe too much) and became even more passionate about migration.

I'm still having trouble getting it to work on Safari. I'll figure it out one day. I'm proud of this though. I've spent way too much time on it, but I think it will be something I can show to a potential employer.

Final summary of my project

I have learned so much over the past three weeks. This project was insane and incredibly rewarding at the same time. I realized that the best way to learn code is just to code. I constantly ran into problems that sent me down some pretty dreadful stack overflow spirals, but nothing beats the feeling of clicking refresh and seeing you finally found the solution.

I went into this project loving Bootstrap. Now, I have a love-hate relationship with it. It has a con for every pro. If I have time during the break, I might go back a rebuild the site without it.

Overall it was a great experience. I think back to the beginning of the semester when we were still learning about span elements, and I see that weâ€™ve come so far.
