              <p>For some, Europe’s migrant crisis evokes images like this one: an overcrowded boat carrying Syrian and Iraqi refugees across the Mediterranean Sea.
              </p>

              <p>For others, it conjures up memories of Europe’s recent terrorist attacks, heightens concerns about national security and sparks political debate over the level of access migrants should be granted to the region.

    <p>The UNHCR estimates that 362,000 refugees and migrants crossed the Mediterranean Sea in 2016. A large majority of those individuals were fleeing war-torn countries like Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan where Islam is the dominant religion.
    </p>

    <p>The influx of migrants has been met by a surge of nationalism and anti-Muslim sentiments throughout Europe. According to a <a href= "http://www.pewglobal.org/2016/07/11/europeans-fear-wave-of-refugees-will-mean-more-terrorism-fewer-jobs/">2016 Pew Research Center study</a>, negative opinions about Muslims have increased in Greece, Spain, Italy, France and the UK since 2015. Many Europeans believe incoming refugees increase the possibility of future terrorist attacks, and more than half of the countries surveyed also said refugees would take away jobs and social benefits.

    <p>France and Germany have the largest Muslim populations in Europe, but Syrian refugees only make up about one percent in each country.</p>

    <p>The apprehension Europeans feel toward refugees today is fueled in part by their unfavorable views of Muslims already living in Europe. To understand the current crisis, it’s essential to look back at previous waves of migration to the region.</p>

    <p>Let’s take a closer look at the influx and treatment of immigrants in France and Germany prior to the current crisis.</p>

      <p>During the industrial revolution and after World War I, the demand for labor in France was high. Consequently, migration was encouraged. Those who migrated to France between 1850 and 1945 originated mostly from neighboring countries, such as Italy, Switzerland and Poland.
      </p>

      <p>After World War II, the source of immigration shifted from European countries to North African countries, particularly Algeria. According to <a href= "https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ag.html">The World Factbook</a>, 99 percent of Algerians identify as Arab Muslims. Unlike the previous waves of migration, which consisted of white Roman Catholics who had to make minor changes to assimilate to French life, Algerians have different socio-cultural characteristics that made assimilating a harder task.

      <p>Algeria became French colony in 1830. After World War II, tensions with the colony heightened, giving rise to the Algerian nationalist movement. The Algerian War for Independence broke out in 1954 and Algeria gained independence in 1962.
      </p>

      <p>This troubling period in history marked by political turmoil and economic uncertainty led thousands of Algerians to migrate to France. <a href= "https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/challenge-french-diversity">The Migration Policy Institute</a> estimates that from 1968 to 1982, the Algerian immigrant population in France nearly doubled from around 470,000 to 800,000.</p>

    <article id="fr_economy">
      <p>France experienced a 30-year period of economic prosperity after World War II during which permanent migration to the country was encouraged.
      </p>

      <p>
      The 1973 oil crisis shook the world economy and put a halt on France’s economic prosperity. The country saw a quick and steady rise in unemployment and inflation. In July 1974, the French government ended the large-scale labor migration from North Africa.
      </p>

      <p>
      Around the same time, France saw the emergence of the National Front, a far-right nationalist political party. The party’s founder Jean Marie Le Pen capitalized on the nation’s growing discontent by drawing a line between rising unemployment and the immigrant population. The rise of anti-immigrant sentiments led to a rightward shift in immigration policy and evidently unfavorable conditions for immigrants.

      <p>Germany and France have similar immigration history. During the first half of the 20th century, Germany received foreign workers from neighboring countries including Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary to fill the unskilled labor gaps in the mining and manufacturing sectors.
      </p>

      <p>
      In the late 1950s, post-war labor shortages prompted the country to sign bilateral recruitment agreements to import foreign labor from Italy, Spain and Greece as well as multiple Muslim nations including Turkey, Morocco and Tunisia.

    <article id="ger_guest">
      <p>Much like in France, recruitment of foreign guest workers continued until the 1973 oil crisis that plunged the country into a recession. By that time, Turkey had surpassed Italy as the most prominent source of immigration. According to the <a href= "https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/germany-immigration-transition">Migration Policy Institute</a>, Turkish people accounted for 23 percent of foreigners in the country.</p>

      <p>Guest workers were expected to enter Germany, work for a few years and then return to their former homes. However, economic and political unrest in Turkey prompted a large portion of them to settle in the Germany.
      </p>

      <p>The unexpected settlement of Turkish immigrants and the period of family reunification that ensued shortly after gave way to xenophobic rhetoric and debates about the country's national identity.

      <p>Unemployment is an immigrant's biggest obstacle to integration.
      </p>

      <p>
      According to <a href= "https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/challenge-french-diversity">Brookings</a>, the unemployment rate among immigrants in France is usually twice as high as the national rate of unemployment. In 2016, the <a href= "https://data.oecd.org/migration/foreign-born-unemployment.htm#indicator-chart">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a> reported that the national unemployment rate in Germany was 3.6 while foreign-born unemployment reached 6.8 percent.

      <p>Political parties in the far right have gained significant popularity in both France and Germany.

      <p>Marine le Pen, the leader of the National Front, came in second place during the 2017 French presidential election.
      </p>

      <p>Germany’s nationalist party, Alternative for Germany, became the third largest party in the federal parliament in 2017.
